                I'm happy the Metaverse failed... ‚ùå
            </h1>
            <p>
                Not in the way it lost millions of dollars in developer time, but it was a rare reminder that hardware and software evolve at different paces. It offers time for developers to reconnect with what the purpose of what the metaverse will turn out as. We already give Facebook so much of our data, why would you trust it to take your reality as well?

                The technology behind cryptocurrency: the blockchain. üîó
            </h1>
            <p>
                The technology behind the blockchain is <b>solid.</b> It relies on cryptographic hash functions that put "blocks" together, each relying on the next's data. This is built-in decentralization, a component that many modern architectures don't have. It's infinitely impossible to alter a blockchain because one party can never have too much control when everyone holds a copy of the same chain.

                What does this all mean? And why is there a stupid monkey? üôà
            </h1>
            <p>
                This is a step in the direction of "decentralizing" our network architectures. No longer does content creation have to all be done and published through Youtube or registered through a copyright office. There's an application that would need such technology in the future whether it's in web architecture, computer security, or even content creation, but like Google Glass and the Nintendo Virtual Boy, it was too early for its time.
