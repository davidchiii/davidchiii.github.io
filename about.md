Undergraduate student at New York University studying computer science and integrated design. Infrastructure manager of [OSIRIS Lab](https://osiris.cyber.nyu.edu). This blog is to document the interesting projects and programming snipplets I've gathered along the way.    

I have interests in full-stack web development, infrastructure development, machine learning, and various security topics. Here's a not-so-complete list of backlogged topics I'm interested in writing:
- [ ] ðŸ”„ Production ready systems and how ~~not~~ to break your web server
- [ ] ðŸ¤– How to use Transformers to make a language model for anything.
- [ ] ðŸ“° [CSAW'23] - How to organize a global CTF in a week and a half.
- [ ] ðŸ“” I regret migrating our infrastructure to ESXI.
