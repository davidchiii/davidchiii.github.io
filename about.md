Undergraduate student at New York University studying computer science and integrated design. Infrastructure manager of [OSIRIS Lab](https://osiris.cyber.nyu.edu). This blog is to document the interesting projects and programming snipplets I've gathered along the way.    

I have interests in full-stack web development, infrastructure development, machine learning, and various security topics.
