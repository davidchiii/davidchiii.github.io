Undergraduate student at New York University studying computer science and integrated design. Infrastructure manager of [OSIRIS](https://osiris.cyber.nyu.edu). This blog is to document the interesting projects and programming snipplets I've gathered along the way. 👩‍💻

I have interests in full-stack web development, infrastructure development, machine learning, and various security topics. Here's a not-so-complete list of backlogged topics I'm interested in writing:
- [ ] 🔄 Production ready systems and how ~~not~~ to break your web server.
- [ ] 🤖 How to use Transformers to make a language model for anything.
- [ ] 📰 [CSAW'23] - linear aggressor writeup.
- [ ] 📰 [CSAW'23] - How to organize a global CTF in a week and a half.
