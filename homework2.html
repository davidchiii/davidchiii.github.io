                Coca-Cola, or Coke, is a carbonated soft drink manufactured by the Coca-Cola Company. In 2013, Coke
                products
                were sold
                in over 200 countries worldwide, with consumers drinking more than 1.8 billion company beverage servings
                each day.[1]
                Coca-Cola ranked No. 87 in the 2018 Fortune 500 list of the largest United States corporations by total
                revenue.[2]
                Based on Interbrand's "best global brand" study of 2020, Coca-Cola was the world's sixth most valuable
                brand.[3]

                The soft drink was developed in 1886 by pharmacist John Stith Pemberton. At the time it was introduced,
                the
                product
                contained cocaine from coca leaves and caffeine from kola nuts which together acted as a stimulant. The
                coca and
                the
                kola are the source of the product name, and led to Coca-Cola's promotion as a "healthy tonic".
                Pemberton had
                been
                severely wounded in the American Civil War, and had become addicted to the pain medication morphine. He
                developed the
                beverage as a patent medicine in an effort to control his addiction.
